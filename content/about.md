Hello World!

I am studying Masters in Telecommunications and Cyber Security at the University of Technology Sydney.
I enjoy working with computers and crawling around web in search for any technology related info, just to keep up with new trends.

A Fitness enthusiast, a guitarist and love practising ethical hacking and software engineering skills with of course a cup of coffee!
