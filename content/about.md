First of all thank you for taking time and scrolling through my portfolio website.

I am Vishal, a recent graduate in Master of Engineering in Telecommunications and Cyber Security from University of Technology Sydney(UTS). 
Why did I choose this field of study?
Well...I studied Bachelors in electronics and communication, and in the third year, I came across an elective called Telecommunication engineering. The advancement of technology in telecommunication always intrigued me, and I wanted to know about how things are working behind all the talks we do on our phone. Since it was an elective, it didn't provide me with enough justified knowledge of telecommunications and networks. It left me with partial knowledge which by the time I graduated, I forgot. :/ 
Worked for almost two years but the partial knowledge bugged me until I left my job and decided to pursue a Master of Engineering. I took majors as Telecommunications because of the reason explained above. I wanted to know MORE!! Soon, I got familiarized with the basics of networking and network protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, DHCP etc. 
Cybersecurity was and is one of the most trending fields. I decided to go with cybersecurity because I was quite intrigued with the major cyber attacks and security breaches. Isn't it fascinating as well as frightening that an individual professional hacker can have skills to take down a whole organization/website/government/you name it? 
I did some research based on security in my assignments(Thought of putting it up here). Have a look in the posts section!!

I am also a Fitness enthusiast, a guitarist and love practising ethical hacking and software engineering skills with of course a cup of coffee!

I have also included my resume and contact details. :)
